#DISEASE THAT APPEARED AS SYMPTOMS OF OTHER DISEASES.
#COMMON-DISEASE RULES:
colds 		= disease(colds) → (dry_c ∨ wet_c) ∧ runy_stufy ∧ sneeze ∧ sore_t
diarrhea 	= disease(diarrhea) → bloating ∧ blood_stool ∧ fever ∧ freq_bowel ∧ nausea ∧ abdomen_p ∧ watery_stool
flu 		= disease(flu) → body_p ∧ [colds] ∧ fwt ∧ fever ∧ headaches

#SPECIFIC-DISEASE RULES SHOULD BE ARRANGED BY MOST COMMON TO MOST RARE. 
#THE POSSIBLE PROBLEM OF THE APPROACH IS THAT IT MAY ASSUME COMPLETE ALREADY DESPITE NOT BEING 'FINISHED' JUST YET.
#SPECIFIC-DISEASE RULES:
tubercolosis	= disease(tubercolosis) → chest_p ∧ blood_cough ∧ fwt ∧ fever ∧ freq_bowel ∧ nausea ∧ abdomen_p ∧ watery_stool
pneumonia		= disease(pneumonia) → ([diarrhea] ∨ fever) ∧ chest_p ∧ fwt ∧ low_temp ∧ naus_or_vom ∧ ssc ∧ wet_c ∧ wheeze
diabetes 		= disease(diabetes) → blurry ∧ fwt ∧ moody ∧ polydipsia ∧ polyphagia ∧ polyuria ∧ slow_heal ∧ weight_loss
measles			= disease(measles) → ([flu] ∨ (fever ∨ runy_stufy)) ∧ sore_eyes ∧ dry_c ∧  ∧ skin_rash ∧ sore_t ∧ white_spot
dengue			= disease(dengue) → ([flu] ∨ (body_p ∨ headaches ∨ fwt)) ∧ naus_or_vom ∧ eye_p ∧ skin_rash ∧ swollen_g ∧ (b_gum_nose ∨ blood_on_stool ∨ blood_on_vomit ∨ liver_large)
malaria			= disease(malaria) → abdomen_p ∧ body_p ∧ (dry_c ∨ wet_c) ∧ fwt ∧ fever ∧ rapid_hr ∧ ssc ∧ wheeze
hypertension	= disease(hypertension) → bp_consult ∨ bp_home ∨ bp_consult
